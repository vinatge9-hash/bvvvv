# Paw & Trust Dog Care - Website

This project includes a simple, production-ready dog care website generated with a single-category prompt. It uses Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and semantic HTML5 structure. The site has four pages: Home, About, Services, and Contact.

How to run locally
- Open the following files in a browser:
  - index.html
  - about.html
  - services.html
  - contact.html

Design notes
- All styling is done with Tailwind CSS classes (no separate CSS files).
- Images are placeholders using the format https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525451031984-340d39c36aa8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxkZXNjcmlwdGlvbnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzU5NzM4OTU5fDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080. The system can replace these with real assets during deployment.
- The hero section on the Home page uses a background image with an overlay for readability.
- Internal navigation is consistent across pages.

Customization tips
- Update the background image by changing the URL in the hero section (index.html).
- Adjust service items by editing the cards in index.html (or duplicating sections in services.html).
- Modify the About page text to reflect your brand story and team.

Accessibility notes
- All images have descriptive alt text.
- Navigation uses semantic elements (header, nav, main, footer).
- Buttons and links include hover states for better UX.
